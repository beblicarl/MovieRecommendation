# MovieRecommendation

Introduction

The goal of this project is to find out similarities within groups of people in order to build a movie recommending system for users using Cluster Analysis. We are going to analyze a dataset from Movielens to explore the characteristics that people share in movies’ taste, based on how they rate them.


# Why Clustering?

    “Unsupervised” learning
        Goal is to segment the data into similar groups instead of prediction
    Can also cluster data into “similar” groups and then build a predictive model for each group
        Be careful not to overfit your model! This works best with large data sets

# Types of Clustering Methods

    There are many different algorithms for clustering
        Differ in what makes a cluster and how to find them
    We will cover
        Hierarchical
        K-means
